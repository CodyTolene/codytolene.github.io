## Notes
If you are considering hosting a GitHub Pages website with this repo, there are a few things to keep in mind:
- I compiled everything (website html and assets) to the root directory becaue this is a "username.github.io" repo.
- If this wasn't a "username.github.io" repo, I would change all compilation export directories to be "~/docs" instead instead of "~/".
