    <!-- MY STORY -->
    <div>
      <h4>My story as a developer</h4>
      <p>
        My journey in software development began over 15 years ago during the
        dot-com boom and what I like to call the "Flash Golden Age" of the
        internet. It was the late 1990's and early 2000's, I was a teenager
        heavily influenced by the Indie Flash Developer community with their
        Flash games and animations, and a huge fanboy of Tom Fulp and
        Newgrounds. Seeking advice from forums on how to get started with Flash,
        I began saving money for Macromedia Flash Professional and took up
        learning ActionScript as soon as I could.
      </p>
      <p>
        By 2006 I was fluent enough with ActionScript 3 to begin creating online
        Flash games taking up roles for programming, animation, and design
        (Photoshop). My dream came true, I'd finally joined the community I'd
        been admiring for those past 7 years; but there was a catch, Flash was
        starting to die out in the digital world due to security vulnerabilities
        and eventually lost the race to different media types. In the late
        2000's I decided to curb Flash and sign up for college. At 18 I learned
        how to program on other platforms using C++, C#, JavaScript, HTML and
        others. My initial learning interests were in game development but in
        college I was creating MySpace templates and Dreamweaver sites on the
        side. This led me into another passion, Web Development!
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- IMAGE:DESKTOP -->
    @if ((breakpointState$ | async) === BreakpointEnum.DESKTOP) {
      <ng-container [ngTemplateOutlet]="myImageTemplate" />
    }

    <!-- WEB DEVELOPMENT -->
    <div>
      <h4>Web Development</h4>
      <p>
        Website development has been the main focus of my career for the past
        decade and every minute of it has been great. I'm experienced within all
        areas of web development from creating static Nunjucks
        brochure/portfolio websites all the way up to global cloud enterprise
        applications. The technologies I use consistently in web development are
        Microsoft's ASP.NET and Google's Angular, these two frameworks are an
        absolute pleasure to work with, a staple in my career path. I've set up
        and hosted websites on the most popular cloud platforms available using
        mixtures of the best technologies.
      </p>
      <h4>Front-end: Presentation layer</h4>
      <p>
        Every website I develop is designed with a mobile-first approach,
        generally using Twitter's flagship styling library "Bootstrap". I like
        to implement Angular when possible for engaging user interfaces and
        progressive web applications. I tend to use a more modern look in my
        designs with the latest and greatest technologies available, while
        maintaining polyfills for backwards support depending on the clients
        needs.
      </p>
      <h4>Back-end: Business and Data layers</h4>
      <p>
        Experienced in hosting, databases and data access, business logic and
        application programming interfaces, I have worked full-spectrum on every
        aspect of a website. For the back-end I prefer programming with the
        ASP.NET (4+/Core) frameworks along with a relational SQL database,
        although I've been working with NoSQL databases a lot as of late.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- GAME DEVELOPMENT -->
    <div>
      <h4>Game Development</h4>
      <p>
        Video games have always been a hobby of mine and it's what got me into
        programming early on in life. My childhood consisted mostly of Mario
        Kart 64 races, Super Smash Bro's beatdowns, and Game Boy Color system
        link battles; one thing was clear, I had an obsession with electronics.
        As a child playing games on the NES, SEGA, Et.al., I was always curious
        of how those great works of art were created. When I was a teen that
        interest had peaked with the advent of Flash, a platform where indie
        developers could easily develope their own games without the need of a
        studio.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had to know how to create my own work of art, I scraped internet
        forums and began teaching myself how to program. Albeit terrible at
        first without a mentor, I began that dream of developing games and
        animations using Flash and ActionScript 3 in the mid 2000's, later
        progressing to C++ and C# in college. Today game development has become
        a hobby of mine where spare time allows.
